# 🦇 Gotham's Air Quality Analysis (Just Kidding, It's India!)
"It’s not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me." – Batman

The air pollution crisis in India is no joke, even for Batman. This project is a data-driven analysis of air quality across all Indian states, identifying the villains (most polluted states) and heroes (cleanest states) in the battle against pollution.

📊 Air Quality Analysis of Indian States (2015-2025)

A comprehensive analysis of air pollution levels across all Indian states using AQI data, including the identification of the most polluted and least polluted states.
This project leverages Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

## 📌 Features

✅ Loads and cleans real-world AQI data from Kaggle

✅ Finds the most and least polluted states based on average AQI

✅ Generates different visualizations, including:

## 🦸‍♂️ Mission Objective

✅ Track down the most polluted states (a.k.a. "Joker's Hideout")

✅ Find the least polluted state (a.k.a. "Batcave of Clean Air")

✅ Use Python and Data Science Gadgets to analyze AQI

✅ Visualize the pollution battle with bar charts, pie charts, and maps

✅ Bring justice to data by presenting insights and solutions
